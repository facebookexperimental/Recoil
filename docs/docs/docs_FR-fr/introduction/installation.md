title: Installation

The Recoil package lives in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm" target="_blank">npm</a>. To install the latest stable version, run the following command:

```shell
npm install recoil
```

Or if you're using <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/" target="_blank">yarn</a>:

```shell
yarn add recoil
```

## ESLint

If you are using [eslint-plugin-react-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) in your project. For example, with an eslint config like this:

```json
// previous .eslint config
{
  "plugins": [
    "react-hooks"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error",
    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn"
  }
}
```

It is recommended to add [`'useRecoilCallback'`](/docs/api-reference/core/useRecoilCallback) to the list of `additionalHooks`. With this change, ESLint will warn when the dependencies passed to `useRecoilCallback()` are specified incorrectly and suggests a fix.  The format of `additionalHooks` is a regex string.

```json
// modified .eslint config
{
  "plugins": [
    "react-hooks"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error",
    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": [
      "warn", {
        "additionalHooks": "useRecoilCallback"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
