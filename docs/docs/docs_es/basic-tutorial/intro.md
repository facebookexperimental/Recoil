This section assumes you have installed Recoil and React. See the [Getting Started](/docs/introduction/getting-started) page for how to get started with Recoil and React from scratch. Components in the following sections are assumed to have a `<RecoilRoot />` in the parent tree.

In this tutorial, we'll be building a simple todo-list application. Our app will be able to do the following:

- Add todo items
- Edit todo items
- Delete todo items
- Filter todo items
- Display useful stats

Along the way, we'll cover atoms, selectors, atom families, and the hooks exposed by the Recoil API. We'll also cover optimization
