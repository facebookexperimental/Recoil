## Create React App

Recoil is a state management library for React, so you need to have React installed and running to use Recoil. The easiest and recommended way for bootstrapping a React application is to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app):

```shell
npx create-react-app my-app
```

> [`npx`](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f).

For more ways to install Create React App, see the [official documentation](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app).

## Installation

The Recoil package lives in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm" target="_blank">npm</a>. To install the latest stable version, run the following command:

```shell
npm install recoil
```

Or if you're using <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/" target="_blank">yarn</a>:

```shell
yarn add recoil
```

Or if you're using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/community/tutorials/install-bower-dependencies-on-google-app-engine" target="_blank">bower</a>:

```shell
bower install --save recoil
```

## RecoilRoot

Components that use recoil state need `RecoilRoot` to appear somewhere in the parent tree. A good place to put this is in your root component:
This can also be your index.js file.
index.js

```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
    import './index.css';
    import App from './App';
    import {RecoilRoot} from 'recoil'


    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
    root.render(
      <React.StrictMode>
          <RecoilRoot>
              <App />
          </RecoilRoot>
      </React.StrictMode>
```

You will need to have an App.js file component that you imported to the index.js file.
The App.js file will take in the following component TexInput, CharCout

import './App.css';
import TextInput from './TextInput';
import CharCout from './CharCout';


const App = () => {

  return (
         <main>
              <TextInput /> 
              <CharCout />
         </main>
   
  );
}

export default App;

We will then naviagate to our src folder to create Those components
We'll implement the `CharacterCounter` component in the following section.

## Atom

An **atom** represents a piece of **state**. Atoms can be read from and written to from any component. Components that read the value of an atom are implicitly **subscribed** to that atom, so any atom updates will result in a re-render of all components subscribed to that atom:

We would start here with the TextInput component

```javascript
    import React from 'react'
    import {atom, useRecoilState} from 'recoil';

    export const inputState = atom({
        key: "inputState",
        default: "",
      });


    function TextInput() {
        const [input, setInput] = useRecoilState(inputState);

        const onChange = (event) => setInput(event.target.value)

      return (
        <div>
            <h1>Text Input</h1>
                <input
                    type='text' 
                    value={input}
                    onChange={onChange}
                />
                <br />
                {'Echo'}
                <br />
                {input}
        </div>
      )
    }


    export default TextInput
```

## Selector

A **selector** represents a piece of **derived state**. Derived state is a **transformation** of state. You can think of derived state as the output of passing state to a pure function that modifies the given state in some way:

We would then proceed to our CharCount component 
```jsx

import { selector, useRecoilValue } from 'recoil';
import { inputState } from './TextInput';


const charCounterText = selector({
    key: 'charCounterText',
    get: ({get}) => {
        const text = get(inputState)
        return text.length;
    },
    
});

we can use the `useRecoilValue()` hook to read the value of `charCounterText`
const CharCout = () => {
    const count = useRecoilValue(charCounterText)
    return (
        <div>Count: {count} </div>
      )    
}

export default CharCout;

```
