Typing and various improvements

<!--truncate-->

### Typing
- Add explicit and required `children` prop to `<RecoilRoot>` and `useRecoilBridgeAcrossReactRoots_UNSTABLE()` for TypeScript to support the [removal of implicit children](https://solverfox.dev/writing/no-implicit-children/) with [`@types/react@^18.0.0](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/56210) for React 18. ([#1718](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1718), [#1717](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1717), [#1726](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1726), [#1731](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1731))
- Update typing for [family parameters](/docs/api-reference/utils/atomFamily#parameter-type) to better support Map, Set, and classes with `toJSON()`. ([#1709](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1709), [#1703](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1703))

### Fixes
- Avoid dev-mode console error with React 18 when using shared async selectors across multiple `<RecoilRoot>`'s. ([#1712](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1712))
- Cleanup potential memory leak when using async selectors. ([#1714](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1714))
- Fix potentially hung async selectors when shared across multiple roots that depend on atoms initialized with promises that don't resolve. ([#1714](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1714))
