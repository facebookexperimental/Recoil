title: Recoil 0.4

We are pleased to announce the release of Recoil 0.4 with initial Recoil Transactions, selector cache configuration, and other optimizations and fixes.

## Recoil Transactions

Introducing Recoil Transactions!  The new [`useRecoilTransaction_UNSTABLE()`](/docs/api-reference/core/useRecoilTransaction) API allow for an easier, more performant, and safer way to atomically update multiple atoms together.  For the simple case this could be thought of as similar to the "updater" form of setting Recoil state, but over multiple atoms.  This new hook is easier to use and should replace the need to use the [`useRecoilCallback()`](/docs/api-reference/core/useRecoilCallback) API most of the time.  It is still preliminary, however, so read the docs for current limitations.

**Example**

Suppose we have two atoms, `positionState` and `headingState`, and we'd like to update them together as part of a single action, where the new value of `positionState` is a function of *both* the current value of `positionState` and `headingState`.  You can accomplish this with a transaction, which must be a pure function without side-effects:

```jsx
const goForward = useRecoilTransaction_UNSTABLE(({get, set}) => (distance) => {
  const heading = get(headingState);
  const position = get(positionState);
  set(positionAtom, {
    x: position.x + cos(heading) * distance,
    y: position.y + sin(heading) * distance,
  });
});
```

Then you can execute the transaction by just calling `goForward(distance)` in an event handler.  This will update state based on the *current* values, not the state when the components rendered.  You can also read the values of previous writes during a transaction.  Because no other updates will be committed while the updater is executing, you will see a consistent store of state.

the previous approach using [`useRecoilCallback()`](/docs/api-reference/core/useRecoilCallback) might have looked like the following:

```jsx
const goForward = useRecoilCallback(({snapshot, gotoSnapshot}) => (distance) => {
  const mutatedSnapshot = snapshot.map(({get, set}) => {
    const heading = get(headingState);
    const position = get(positonState);
    set(positionState, {
      x: position.x + cos(heading) * distance,
      y: position.y + sin(heading) * distance,
    });
  });
  gotoSnapshot(mutatedSnapshot);
});
```

This has the following drawbacks:
* There is performance overhead for managing the full generality of snapshots.
* There is more opportunity for bugs:  The snapshot might be retained and used in the future.  Since a snapshot contains the complete set of Recoil state, not just a changeset, that could accidentally rewind changes that occurred between creating and committing the snapshot.

**Reducer Example**

You can also use this hook to create a reducer pattern of executing actions over multiple atoms:

```jsx
const reducer = useRecoilTransaction_UNSTABLE(({get, set}) => action => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'goForward':
      const heading = get(headingState);
      set(positionState, position => {
        x: position.x + cos(heading) * action.distance,
        y: position.y + sin(heading) * action.distance,
      });
      break;

    case 'turn':
      set(headingState, action.heading);
      break;
  }
});
```

*There are various limitations and future plans for transactions, please [read the docs](/docs/api-reference/core/useRecoilTransaction#current-limitations-and-future-vision).*

## Selector Cache Policy Configuration

***TODO***

TODO NOTE: Default may change in the future.

## Fixes and Optimizations

- Fix TypeScript typing for `selectorFamily()`, `getCallback()`, `useGetRecoilValueInfo()`, and `Snapshot#getNodes()` ([#1060](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1060), [#1116](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1116), [#1123](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1123))
- Allow mutable values in selectors (enabled via the `dangerouslyAllowMutability` selector option) to be used with `waitFor*()` helpers such as [`waitForAll()`](/docs/api-reference/utils/waitForAll) ([#1074](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1074), [#1096](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1096))
- [Atom Effects](/docs/guides/atom-effects) fixes:
  - Fix `onSet()` handler to get the proper new value when an atom is reset or has an async default Promise that resolves ([#1059](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1059), [#1050](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1050), [#738](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/738)) (This is a slightly breaking change because the actual new value will be provided to the handler instead of a `DefaultValue` placeholder)
  - Fix support for multiple Atom Effects cleanup handlers ([#1125](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1125))
  - Fix selector subscriptions when atoms with effects are initialized via a `Snapshot` ([#1135](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1135), [#1107](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1107))
- Optimization for async selectors when dependencies resolve to cached values ([#1037](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1037))
- Remove unnecessary warning message ([#1034](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1034), [#1062](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1062))
