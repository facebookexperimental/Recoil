Welcome to Recoil 0.5 with a few new APIs and improvements.

<!--truncate-->

## Hook for refreshing selectors

The [`useRecoilRefresher_UNSTABLE()`](/docs/api-reference/core/useRecoilRefresher) hook has been added for refreshing selectors that execute data queries.  This is useful if you just want to refresh for newer data or retry due to an error.  ([#972](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/972), [#1294](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1294), [#1302](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1302))

## Atom effect improvements

* Add `isReset` parameter to `onSet()` callback to know if the atom was reset.  ([#1358](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1358), [#1345](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1345))
* Add `getLoadable()`, `getPromise()`, and `getInfo_UNSTABLE()` for reading other atoms.  ([#1205](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1205), [#1210](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1210))

## Loadable factories

The [`RecoilLoadable`](/docs/api-reference/core/Loadable#creating-loadables) interface is now available for making your own `Loadable` objects.  ([#1263](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1263), [#1264](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1264), [#1312](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1312))

## Other fixes and improvements

- Allow class instances in family parameters for Flow ([#1215](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1215))
- `Loadable` improvements:
  - Ability to map Loadables with other Loadables. ([#1180](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1180))
  - Re-implement Loadable as classes. ([#1315](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1315))
- Fix user-thrown promises in selectors for some cases.
- Improved dev-mode checks:
  - Atoms freeze default, initialized, and async values.  Selectors should not freeze upstream dependencies. ([#1261](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1261), [#1259](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1259))
  - Perform runtime check that required options are provided when creating atoms and selectors. ([#1324](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1324))
- Upgrade Prettier version ([#1366](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/1366))

*Also lots of restructuring in preparation for the upcoming `recoil-sync` library release...*
