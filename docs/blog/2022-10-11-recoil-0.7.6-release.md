title: Recoil 0.7.6
---

- Expose flag to disable "duplicate atom key" checking / logging, as it was too noisy in environments such as NextJS or some dev environments using Fast Refresh. ([#733](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/733), [#2020](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/2020), [#2046](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/2046))
  - Import `RecoilEnv` from the recoil package, and set `RecoilEnv.RECOIL_DUPLICATE_ATOM_KEY_CHECKING_ENABLED = false` in code to disable the checking and logging.
  - We also support `process.env.RECOIL_DUPLICATE_ATOM_KEY_CHECKING_ENABLED=false` in NodeJS environments such as NextJs
  - ***Caution***: This disables all checks for duplicate atom keys including legitimate errors, so use with caution!

- Workaround for React 18 environments with nested renderers that don't support `useSyncExternalStore()`. ([#2001](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/2001), [#2010](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/2010))
