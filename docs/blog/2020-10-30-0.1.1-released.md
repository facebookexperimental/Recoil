title: Recoil 0.1.1
---

Welcome to Recoil version 0.1.1!  This release has performance improvements and introduces several *experimental* features such as support for React Native, working with Snapshots outside of React, and atom effects for managing side-effects of atoms such as logging, synchronization with external stores, persistence, etc.

Also, [nightly builds](/docs/introduction/installation#nightly-builds) are now available via the `nightly` branch.

## Performance

Several changes to improve Recoil's performance:
* Updates performed during `useRecoilCallback()` are now batched, which avoids copying data structures or performing updates for intermediate states.  This allowed setting 5,000 atoms in a loop to go from 10s -> 25ms with some of our stress tests. ([@davidmccabe](https://github.com/davidmccabe))
* Recoil also now avoids looking up selector values in cache if the selector's dependencies have not changed.  This improved some applications with complex data-flow graphs by 30-40x. ([@davidmccabe](https://github.com/davidmccabe))

## React Native (*Experimental*)

Recoil should now work with the React Native environment.  However, similar to server side rendering, it is not officially supported. ([#114](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/114) - [@jacques-blom](https://github.com/jacques-blom), [@mondaychen](https://github.com/mondaychen))

## Atom Effects (*Experimental*)

[Effects for atoms](/docs/guides/atom-effects) simplifies managing side-effect policies for atoms on a per-atom basis as part of the `atom()` or `atomFamily()` definition.  Effects can be used for interesting applications such as [logging](/docs/guides/atom-effects#logging-example) and state synchronization or persistence with external storage such as [remote databases](/docs/guides/atom-effects#state-synchronization-example), [local storage](/docs/guides/atom-effects#local-storage-persistence), browser URL history, etc.  For example, you could use an atom as a local copy of some user state and provide an effect to subscribe to changes on a server to update the local copy and for local changes to write-through and update the server.

## Snapshots for Testing (*Experimental*)

Snapshots can now be [constructed outside of a React context](/docs/api-reference/core/Snapshot#building-a-snapshot).  This can be useful for [testing](/docs/guides/testing) or evaluating selectors outside of a React context.

* Do not freeze objects which should not be frozen. ([#597](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/597), [#633](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/633), [#672](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/672) &#8212; [@RinGoku](https://github.com/RinGoku), [@a-sane](https://github.com/a-sane))
* TypeScript typing for `Snapshot`. ([#687](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/687) &#8212; [@kevinfrei](https://github.com/kevinfrei), [@drarmstr](https://github.com/drarmstr), [@habond](https://github.com/habond))
* Additional testing for `waitForAll()` concurrency. ([#681](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil/pull/681) &#8212; [@drarmstr](https://github.com/drarmstr))

## Future Work

In a future release, Recoil will automatically free the memory used by atoms and selectors that are no longer used, and will perform better with larger numbers of atoms. ([@davidmccabe](https://github.com/davidmccabe))

Releasing our prototype Chrome developer tools. ([@maxijb](https://github.com/maxijb))

Libraries of effects for common state persistence, such as browser local storage or URL history. ([@bezi](https://github.com/bezi))

Thanks for your continued interest in Recoil!
