/**
 * This is an opinionated tree cache that conforms to the requirements needed
 * by Recoil selectors.
 *
 * Unlike a conventional cache, the tree cache does not store key-value pairs,
 * but "routes" that point to values. In the context of selectors these routes
 * represent dependencies that a selector has to other atoms and selectors.
 *
 * In order to retrieve a value from the cache, a function is passed to the
 * cache's `get()` method, and the tree cache will use that function to traverse
 * itself, passing the provided function a "key" (the first part of the route tuple),
 * reconstructing the route to some value (or undefined).
 *
 * The handlers are necessary for the selector to be able to capture the
 * incremental nodes in the tree that are traversed while looking for a cache
 * hit as these incremental nodes represent dependencies to the selector, which
 * are used internally by the selector.
